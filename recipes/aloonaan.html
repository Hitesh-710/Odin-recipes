    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aloo naan is a soft, leavened Indian flatbread stuffed with a flavorful potato filling. Made with all-purpose flour, yogurt, and yeast or baking powder, the dough is kneaded to perfection and allowed to rest for a fluffy texture. The potato stuffing is spiced with ingredients like cumin, coriander, green chilies, and garam masala, creating a delicious and aromatic blend. Once assembled, the naan is rolled out and cooked in a tandoor or on a hot skillet until golden and slightly charred. Aloo naan is best enjoyed with curries, yogurt, or pickles, offering a comforting and satisfying meal.</p>
