    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Suji ka halwa, or semolina pudding, is a classic Indian dessert made from roasted semolina, ghee, sugar, and water or milk. The semolina is toasted in ghee until golden and aromatic, then simmered with a sweetened liquid to create a soft, smooth texture. Often flavored with cardamom and garnished with nuts like almonds, cashews, and raisins, suji ka halwa is rich, comforting, and mildly sweet. It is a popular dish for festive occasions, religious ceremonies, or as a quick homemade treat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 cup semolina (suji)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Heat ghee in a pan and roast the semolina (suji) on medium heat until golden and aromatic, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, heat water or milk until warm; add sugar and stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the sweetened liquid into the roasted semolina while stirring to avoid lumps.</li>
