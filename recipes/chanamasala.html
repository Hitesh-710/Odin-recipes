    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chana Masala is a popular and flavorful vegetarian dish from Indian cuisine, primarily made with chickpeas (chana) cooked in a rich, spiced tomato-based gravy. The dish is characterized by a balance of tangy, savory, and mildly spicy flavors. Key ingredients include onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and a variety of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder. Some variations may also include ingredients like cilantro, green chilies, or a touch of lemon juice to enhance the taste. 

        The chickpeas absorb the aromatic spices, creating a hearty and satisfying dish. Chana Masala is often served with rice, naan, or roti, making it a staple in many Indian households and restaurants worldwide. It's known for being both nutritious and filling, offering a good source of protein and fiber.</p>
